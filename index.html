      In contemporary sport, performance no longer happens solely on the pitch—it unfolds simultaneously on the screen. 
       Today, visibility is not an after-effect of achievement but part of the performance itself.

      <i>The Feed is in the Field</i> explores how athletes, influencers, and celebrities now occupy the same visual economy, 
      producing and consuming images in real time. The boundaries between sport and social media blur, creating new forms of 
      attention, pressure, and spectacle.

      This project invites the viewer to navigate the webpage as if it were a social media feed, where each stage exposes a different layer of how sport and digital culture now intersect. 
       As the pages progress, the distinctions between sporting performance, media coverage, and online self-presentation blur, eventually collapsing into a space where their differences are no longer visible.
        Through this breakdown, the work examines how contemporary visibility reshapes not only how sport is consumed, but how identity and meaning are produced within an attention-driven system.
