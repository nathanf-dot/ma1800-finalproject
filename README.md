The Feed is the Field is a web-based artwork that examines the collapsing boundaries between professional sport, influencer culture, and the visual logics of contemporary social media feeds. Drawing from the attention economy and the spectacle of sport, the work explores how athletes and influencers increasingly occupy the same visual and cultural terrain, mediated through the aesthetics of platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and X.

The website leads the viewer through three stages — Clean Feed, Flooded Signals, and Collapse Point — each visualising a progressive breakdown. Beginning with a curated, highly polished grid, the experience evolves into an oversaturated media environment and finally into a moment of collapse, where images, notifications, noise, and glitches merge into an indistinguishable mass. The project draws inspiration from interface studies, glitch art, and sports media analysis to question how visibility functions as a new kind of labour and how digital spectatorship reshapes the meaning of performance.

In terms of functionality, the web-art project uses a grid system on the three main pages to emulate the layout of a social media platform. It also uses hover interactions on many of the image/video tiles with effects such as fading, glitching and layered text reveals. Some effects to mimic that of a social media feed and others to potray the breakdown of the project as you progress. In the latter pages, you can see the use of RGB splits and flicker animations used to visualise the digital instability of those points. I wanted to make the experience intentionally visual and interactive, to encourage the viewer to interact with the pages, as i wanted the page to almost seem like it had a living aspect to it. growing with each new page.

I faced numerous challenges during the development of this project. An example was having to balance the aesthetics of the page with its readability, as the project relies heavily on visual distortion, I was tasked with creating a glitch effect on certain texts that communicated this breakdown without making the text completely unreadable. Another challenge was the construction of the Instagram-like grids as after using the image-grid some images were not sized correctly, achieving a seamless grid was difficult and careful refinement was used in order to make the grids fit perfectly in the 3x3 system. I also faced many individual issues across separate pages which some I was able to handle but others i was forced to abandon the idea, an example was for the final page I had wanted to change the backgroud to an image that represented an error message or complete breakdown but I could not find an image that would fit and look natural.

In terms of extensions to the project, if given more time i would have liked to see if I could have included deeper user interactions, where clicking, scrolling, or idling would trigger a different breakdown sequence or interaction with the page. Like interacting with the icons on the "Clean Feed" page would lead to some sort of reaction on the page, or perhaps how the user interacted with the page before affects the experience they would have on the latter pages. I think given more time I would have liked to explore a greater level of interactivity for the viewer.


In terms of how I found my images, videos and audios, all of the images of athletes, influencers, or celebrities were sourced either with a simple google search or via their Instagram feed. The videos, such as all of the glitch animations used on the "Collapse Point" page, or the notification counter on "Flooded Signals" were sourced on the website pexels, and the video of the New York Knicks fans celebrating was a screen recording of a Youtube video. And the audio I used was downloaded off freesound.org.
